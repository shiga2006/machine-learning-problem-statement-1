Project Overview
This application uses trained models to predict breast cancer (specifically classifying as malignant or benign) and cervical cancer (indicating positive or negative risk). Additionally, it includes a report analyzer feature to extract information from uploaded medical reports. Predictions are based on pre-defined features, and a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter simplifies the process of interacting with the tool.

Features
Breast Cancer Detection: Input 27 features associated with breast cancer (e.g., radius, texture, symmetry) to receive a prediction on whether the tumor is likely malignant or benign.
Cervical Cancer Detection: Input various lifestyle and health factors to determine the risk of cervical cancer.
Symptom Bot: Placeholder feature for future integration of symptom-based health predictions.
Report Analyzer: Extract relevant medical metrics from uploaded PDF and DOCX reports.
Detailed Result Information: Each prediction includes an explanation and suggested next steps.
